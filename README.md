## 1. Introduction
This report covers the experience in designing, developing, and implementing a library management system built as a Windows desktop application using C# and Microsoft Visual Studio. The project, named **Insight Library**, utilized Windows Forms and a service-based database to build the system. The system allows the registration of new librarians and login functionality to add books and clients' details through three MS Windows forms: **Register**, **Login**, and **Work Interface**. 

The system stores data in a local database, enabling librarians to add borrowing orders to the database with unique book and client references, as well as the librarian's username. This documentation covers a comprehensive analysis of the system's interface design, database design, class implementation, and program functionality.

## 2. Literature Review
After determining the scope of the Windows desktop application, many examples with similar features and limitations were explored, particularly from platforms like YouTube. Several academic technologies and systems were also reviewed, including **LibraryThing**, **Koha**, and **Evergreen**, which are designed to manage library collections, client details, and borrowing orders (Brahmi and Nouali-Taboudjemat, 2019; Obeidat, 2019; Pishgooie, Zahedi, and Hamzehei, 2021).

Additionally, **LibraryWorld** was identified as a web-based library management system suitable for small and medium-sized libraries. Many features from LibraryWorld were incorporated into the Insight Library system (LibraryWorld, 2023).

## 3. Interface Design

### 3.1 Registration Form
The registration form allows the user, who will act as a librarian, to register with a unique username, password, full name, and license ID number. However, this form is not the first to appear after running the application. The login form appears first.

### 3.2 Login Form
Upon running the application, the first interface displayed is the login form. Users can either log in with existing credentials or create a new account by using the registration hyperlink, which opens the registration form.

### 3.3 The Work Interface Form
Once logged in, the user is presented with the **Work Interface** form. This form allows the librarian to navigate through three main panels for managing **Books**, **Clients**, and **Borrowing Orders**. Each panel contains text boxes for input and management through four buttons: **Add**, **Update**, **Clear**, and **Delete**. Data is displayed using a data grid view for ease of navigation and management.

## 4. Data Storage
The Insight Library Management System uses a service-based database for storing data locally. The system handles book details, client information, and borrowing orders, ensuring that the data is properly organized and retrievable as needed.

## 5. Program Functionality (ERD)

The Insight Library system primarily revolves around one form for the work interface, where the majority of event handling takes place. Although the class structure is not clearly organized due to the reliance on one form, the following class diagram illustrates how the system could have been more efficiently organized. Future modifications are planned to improve the class structure.
